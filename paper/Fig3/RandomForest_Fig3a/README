These scripts run 5-fold CV Random Forest model for compositions features in features/Featurized_compositions_concat_Li_and_cat.pickle
and compute and plot the feature importance.

To reproduce the random forest results for compositions featurised as in Eq. 3 :

Run:
   python RF_classify.py features/Featurized_compositions_LEAFsa.pickle
