## Element similarity in high-dimensional materials representations

The folder `element_similarity` contains the scripts used to produce the results in the Publication: "Element similarity in high-dimensional materials representations"

Installing `SMACT==2.5.3` and `ElementEmbeddings==0.4` via pip should install all the necessary packages required to reproduce the results. We do provide all the packages which were installed at the time of running the notebooks for full transparency in the file `requirements_publication.txt`.
