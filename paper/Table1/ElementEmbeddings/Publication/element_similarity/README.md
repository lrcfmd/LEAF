# Element similarity in high-dimensional materials representations

* The notebook `similarity_periodic_trends/similarity_measures.ipynb` is used to reproduce the dis/similarity heatmaps and 2D projections
* The notebook `csp/data_radius_ratio_rules.ipynb` is used to get the dataset and calculate the radius ratio rules.
* The notebook `csp/cosine_embeddings.ipynb` is used to generate the pairwise cosine similarity values
* The notebook `csp/smact_sp` is used to perform the structure prediction using SMACT
