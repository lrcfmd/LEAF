# Getting Started

The latest stable release can be installed via pip using:

```bash
pip install ElementEmbeddings
```

## Developer's installation (optional)

For development work, `ElementEmbeddings` can eb installed from a copy of the [source repository](https://github.com/WMD-group/ElementEmbeddings.git); this is preferred if using experimental code branches.

To clone the project from Github and make a local installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WMD-group/ElementEmbeddings.git
cd ElementEmbeddings
pip install -e .
``` 

With `-e`, pip will create links to the source folder so that the changes to the code will be reflected on the PATH.
