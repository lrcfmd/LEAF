# Elemental Embeddings

The data contained in this folder is a collection of various elemental representation/embedding schemes. We provide the literature source for these representations as well as the data source for which the files were obtained. A majority of these representations have been obtained from the following repositories:

* [lrcfmd/ElMD](https://github.com/lrcfmd/ElMD/tree/master)
* [Kaaiian/CBFV](https://github.com/Kaaiian/CBFV/tree/master)

## Linear representations

For the linear/scalar representations, the `Embedding` class will load these representations as one-hot vectors where the vector components are ordered following the scale (i.e. the `atomic` representation is ordered by atomic numbers).

### Modified Pettifor scale

The following paper describes the details of the modified Pettifor chemical scale:
[The optimal one-dimensional periodic table: a modified Pettifor chemical scale from data mining](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/18/9/093011/meta)

[Data source](https://github.com/lrcfmd/ElMD/blob/master/ElMD/el_lookup/mod_petti.json)

### Atomic numbers

We included `atomic` as a linear representation to generate one-hot vectors corresponding to the atomic numbers

## Vector representations

The following representations are all vector representations (some are local, some are distributed) and the `Embedding` class will load these representations as they are.

### Magpie

The following paper describes the details of the Materials Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration (Magpie) framework:

We have preprocessed the original `oliynyk.csv` to account for the missing values. The preprocessed file is called `oliynyk_preprocessed.csv` which is now the default file which is called by `load_data`.

The 44 features of the embedding vector are formed of the following properties:

### Random

This is a set of 200-dimensional vectors in which the components are randomly generated

The 118 200-dimensional vectors in `random_200_new` were generated using the following code:

```python
import numpy as np

mu , sigma = 0 , 1 # mean and standard deviation s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)
s = np.random.default_rng(seed=42).normal(mu, sigma, (118,200))
```
