Results of the Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) in Table 1 rely on 
the test presented in Ref: A. Onwuli et al Digit. Discov. 2023,2, 1558-1564

Reproduction of the results requires the original code
 https://github.com/WMD-group/ElementEmbeddings
copied here.

Results for LEAFs were achieved with this code, by including LEAFs features into 
ElementEmbeddings/src/elementembeddings/data/element_representations/LEAF_average.csv

and reruning the experiment in
ElementEmbeddings/Publication/element_similarity/csp

Results for GNoME were achieved, by first collecting elemental statistics in GNoME data
(analogous to Hautier approach) and running the experiment in 
ElementEmbeddings/Publication/element_similarity/csp/gnome
